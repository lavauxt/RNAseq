#Y-linked Genes (Male-biased)

#    Canonical Y-linked genes like Ddx3y, Eif2s3y, Uty, and Kdm5d are well-known for their roles in male sex determination and spermatogenesis. These genes are commonly referenced in mouse gene expression studies and are essential for male development.

#X-linked Genes (Female-biased or X-Chromosome Genes)

#    X-inactivation-related genes like Xist, Tsix, and Rlim play crucial roles in dosage compensation between sexes by silencing one X chromosome in female cells.

#    Dosage-sensitive genes like Kdm6a and Eif2s3x, which escape X-inactivation, are expressed in both male and female cells, but often at higher levels in females due to their escape from inactivation.

#    X-linked immune-related genes such as Tlr7 and Foxp3, which are involved in immune system function, are known to have sex-biased expression in female-biased autoimmunity.

#    Other X-linked genes, including Ddx3x, Usp9x, and Fmr1, are critical for various cellular functions and are known to show differential expression between the sexes.
